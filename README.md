The **0x00. Shell, basics** Project : is project based on helping students understand some of the basics of shell script programming, and hopefully to introduce some of the possibilities of simple but powerful programming available under the Bourne shell. As such, it has been written as a basis for one-on-one or group tutorials and exercises, and as a reference for subsequent use.
